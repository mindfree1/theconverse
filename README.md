The start of The Converse - Inspiring well-thought out discussions!

This project will be to build out The COnverse platform and web app.
The overall idea and concept is to create a place where fueling constructive conversation can happen and not only happen but be fostered. New ideas around design, architecture, development and constructs not used before will be applied to do something totally different than what any news site is currently doing, what no blog or commenting system has tried before in whole. SUre there have been some great parts and innovations but it's still not enough so I will be attempting this time to push the boundaries on anything I've ever done before. This will be a platform for the people by the people, a place that will eventually become decentralized and take constructive news stories, constructive debate, with the ultiamte aim to allow actual change to occur in the world through the platform. Consider this the start of my Grand Opus with much more to come....
