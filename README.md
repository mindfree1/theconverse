The start of The Converse - Inspiring well-thought out discussions!

This project will be to build out The Converse platform and web app.

The overall idea and concept is to create a place where fueling constructive conversation can happen and not only happen but be fostered. New ideas around design, architecture, development and constructs not used before will be applied to do something totally different than what any news site is currently doing, what no blog or commenting system has tried before in whole. Sure there have been some great parts and innovations but it's still not enough. 

Therefore I will be attempting this time to push the boundaries on anything I've ever done before. This will be a platform for the people by the people, a place that will eventually become decentralized and take constructive news stories, constructive debate, with the ultimate aim to allow actual change to occur in the world through the platform. 

Commenting will be segrated out into a more 'for' / 'against' approach helping to hopefully from a design perspective break away from the constructs of the typical chronilogical commenting systems inherited from the blog / forum days. IN this way hopefully building out social sentitment will be more easily achieved. A potentail 'karma' based system will be looked at and employ in order to offer incentive to users to provide and links to comments, articles, videos, sources overall that provide obejctive and constructive opinion. Bigger ideas are utilizing blockchain and AI modelling combined with the crowd sourced karma system to help reduce and/or eliminate fake news.

The platform ultimate goal is provide a place not just for constructive debate but to really drive social change, governmental policy change and expand upon people's views (aka removing bias) as much as possible. The thought being that if users are required to both link to qulaified sources and are incentived in a non-negative way that maybe, just maybe, we can change how people interact with the news and in some ways give more rise to citizen-news.
